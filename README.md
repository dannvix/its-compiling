it's compiling
==============

This is for my personal blog [`it's compiling`](http://blog.owo.tw). Here hosts the back-end system, which is a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). The front-end is hosted by [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) in the [`gh-pages` branch](http://github.com/dannvix/its-compiling/tree/gh-pages).


Story
-----
I wanted a personal blog and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is what first come to my mind. However, I found that Octopress is too powerful and so hard to be customized for me. Then I was going to hack my own site generator.
